# specify first vector overhang. start_oh_pos represents position of first
# overhang base position to the first codon's start in the parent sequences,
# indexing from 0
# Example 1: parent sequence: "ATGGATC...", overhang sequence: "TATG"
#     -> start_oh_pos = -1 to make the "ATG" in both sequences to line up
# Example 2: parent sequence "CATGTAC...", overhang sequence: "TATG"
#     -> start_oh_pos = -4 to append the overhang onto the sequences
#         with no overlap
# start_oh_pos can range from -4 to -1, inclusive.
